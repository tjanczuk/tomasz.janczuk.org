We are shipping WCF RIA Services V1.0 SP1 Beta today, just in time for PDC 2010. The release addresses some of the [key feature asks](http://riaservices.mswish.net/) we have received from the developer community after the successful WCF RIA 1.0 release. You can download WCF RIA Services at [http://www.silverlight.net/getstarted/riaservices/](http://www.silverlight.net/getstarted/riaservices/).   

Enhancements in the [WCF RIA Services V1.0 SP1 Beta](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=205085) product itself include:  

* **Shared entities**. Several domain services can now use the same entity type.  
* **Complex objects**. WCF RIA now supports structural non-entity types. Read more at [Mathew Charles’s blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/digital_ruminations/archive/2010/10/28/complextypes-in-ria-services.aspx).  
* **ICollectionViewFactory** support. Read more at [Kyle McClellan’s blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/kylemc/archive/tags/pdc10/).  
* **Client code generation extensibility point**. It allows customization of the process of generating client side code artifacts for a domain service.  
* The product is now **localized in 10 languages**.  
  

The product release is accompanied by the [WCF RIA Services Toolkit October 2010](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=205088), with an early preview of a few exciting features:  

* Domain Service support for **Windows Azure Table Storage**. When hosting WCF RIA Services in Windows Azure, you can now easily leverage Windows Azure Table Storage as your data backend. Read more at [Kyle McClellan’s blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/kylemc/archive/tags/pdc10/).  
* **T4 template based client code generation**. The feature leverages the code generation extensibility point added to the product and provides a well factored and granular mechanism to customize client code generation logic using T4 templates.
