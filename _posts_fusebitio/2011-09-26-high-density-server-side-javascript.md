I will be speaking about high density server side JavaScript at JSConf.EU 2011 next weekend. Here is the abstract:  

>
> Cloud computing reduces the cost of running applications with economies of scale. Major factor in this cost reduction is the granularity of assigning computing resources (CPU, memory, network) to competing applications. Physical machines, virtual machines, and OS processes have been successfully used to provide isolated quantities of computing power at decreasing levels of cost. Pushing the granularity of computing power to sub-process level would allow offering shared hosting plans at a fraction of the cost possible today. Server side JavaScript is an ideal solution to support sub-process application density in a multi-tenant environment. It yields itself very well to sandboxing applications and controlling the use of computing resources. This talk explores the limits of application density and therefore cost reduction of running server side JavaScript code using a variety of approaches.
