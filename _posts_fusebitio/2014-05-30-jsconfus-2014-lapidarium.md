Eleanor Roosevelt once said “*Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people*”. During JSConf  ideas are discussed. This also leaves a lot of time for conversations *between* people.   

I had the privilege to speak during JSConf.US 2014 on the topic of [in-process interop between Node.js and CLR](http://tjanczuk.github.io/edge). However, the true highlight of the event for me was watching other talks and engaging in deeper conversations with fellow attendees and speakers, some of whom I have known in person or via internet before, and some of whom I just met.   

Below are selected takeaways from these presentations and conversations, in no particular order.   

>
> *Sometimes the best way to connect with people is to disconnect from internet [[@renrutnnej](http://twitter.com/renrutnnej), [@brianloveswords](http://twitter.com/brianloveswords)]*
>
> *A capacitor can be used to stabilize circuit voltage [[@digitalman2112](https://twitter.com/digitalman2112)]*
>
> *One can go from knowing nothing about electronics to building a NodeBoat controlled remotely via WiFi from a MacBook or a Pebble in under 6 hours [[@rhagigi](https://twitter.com/digitalman2112), [@digitalman2112](https://twitter.com/digitalman2112), [yours truly](https://twitter.com/tjanczuk)]*
>
> *Immutable memory structures are good for you, and so is ClosureScript [[@swannodette](http://twitter.com/swannodette)]*
>
> *The best way to optimize GC is to not use it. At least when working with HTML5 canvas [[@angelinamagnum](https://twitter.com/angelinamagnum)]*
>
> *JavaScript isomorphism is a trade off between the level of code reuse and the number of abstractions that need to be built [[@spikebrehm](http://twitter.com/spikebrehm)]*
>
> *You can live-code a JavaScript game using Rx and ES6 in under 30 minutes. It is not certain, however, which of the three enable this: Rx, ES6, or being Bodil Stokke [**@bodil**]*
>
> *You can engage in a distributed art project with perfect strangers by shaking your iPhone like a madman [[@whichlight](http://twitter.com/whichlight)]*
>
> *You cannot* *engage in a distributed art project with perfect strangers by shaking your Windows Phone like a madman for lack of Web Audio API support [[yours truly](https://twitter.com/tjanczuk)]*
>
> *You can transpile ES6 generators and other constructs to ES5 by converting the code to a state machine, and sprinkling it with a healthy dose of pixie dust [[@benjamn](https://twitter.com/benjamn)]*
>
> *On the note of pixie dust, did I mention you can code a Little Pony JavaScript game using Rx and ES6 in under 30 mins [@bodil]*
>
> *Spy satellites have elongated orbits to allow them to get close to Earth on every pass [[@franksvalli](https://twitter.com/franksvalli)]*
>
> *Electric motor servos are not watertight [[yours truly](https://twitter.com/tjanczuk)]*
>
> *Any mobile internet of things big data set in the cloud can be efficiently sorted with jortSort [[@jennschiffer](https://twitter.com/jennschiffer)]*  

I am leaving JSConf.US 2014 with a lot of new *ideas* in my head and the memory of great conversations with *people*. Conference, defined.   }
