Last week Carl Franklin and Richard Campbell from DotNetRocks [interviewed me about running node.js applications on Windows](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=711). This is an introductory talk meant to introduce the node.js framework to .NET developers without prior experience with it. It also highlights the efforts around making Windows a great platform to run node.js applications, either standalone or [in IIS using iisnode](https://github.com/tjanczuk/iisnode). The interview starts around minute 7 and lasts around 40. Enjoy!
