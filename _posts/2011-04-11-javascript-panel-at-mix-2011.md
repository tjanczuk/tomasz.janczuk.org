 ![See You at MIX11](https://msteched.blob.core.windows.net/media/Default/BlogPost/news/MIX11_BB_SeeYouAt_1.gif)

I have lately picked up interest in the server side application of JavaScript and had a chance to learn and experiment with domain technologies. Related to that is my presence on the JavaScript panel at MIX 2011 on Wednesday April 13 at 3:30pm-4:30pm at Lagoon H. You are welcome to attend, or otherwise drop me a line if you are interested in discussing this topic.

The full MIX schedule is [here](http://live.visitmix.com/MIX11/Schedule). Promises to be an interesting event.
